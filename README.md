# My\_SDL\_Template

**Description**

This project is a **cross-platform SDL3 C++ projects**. It allows you to quickly create and compile applications on **Linux, Windows**. Using the provided **Makefile shortcuts**, required packages are automatically installed via **vcpkg**, and the **build process via CMake** is simplified.

## Used Tools & Terms

* **SDL3** â€“ A C++ library for building cross-platform multimedia applications. With SDL3, programs can be compiled for **Linux, macOS, Windows, and more** ([platforms](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-platforms)).
* **vcpkg** â€“ A C++ package manager for easily downloading and managing libraries like SDL3.
* **Makefile** â€“ Provides shortcuts to automatically execute build and run commands for different platforms.
* **CMakeLists.txt** â€“ Configuration file for CMake that defines how the project is built, including sources, dependencies, and compiler settings.

## Creating `.pak` Files

Assets are automatically bundled into `.pak` files during the build process. Each folder inside the assets directory becomes a separate `.pak` file. The build system goes **recursively through all subfolders** of the `assets` folder. For each folder:

* All files **directly inside that folder** are bundled into a `.pak` named after the folder (e.g., `hero.pak`).
* Subfolders **inside a folder are not included** in the parent folder's `.pak`; they generate their **own `.pak` files** with the same rules.
* No `.pak` files are created at the **top level** of the `assets` directory.

The `.pak` files are stored in the build folder under the same relative path, for example:

```
bin/<Build-tool>/sprites/mid/hero.pak
```

---

### Structure of a `.pak` File

```
+----------------------------+
| Header                     |
| - Signature "PACK"         |
| - Directory Offset         |
| - Directory Size           |
+----------------------------+
| Data Section               |
| - File 1                   |
| - File 2                   |
| - ...                      |
+----------------------------+
| Directory at the End       |
| - Path to File 1 + Offset + Size |
| - Path to File 2 + Offset + Size |
| - ...                      |
+----------------------------+
```

**Example of a `.pak` File**

Suppose you have the following files in `assets/sprites/mid/hero/`:

```
walk.png  (Size: 4557 Bytes)
stay.png  (Size: 4557 Bytes)
```

The `.pak` directory entries would look like this:

```
Added file: path: assets/sprites/mid/hero/walk.png, Offset: 12, Size: 4557
Added file: path: assets/sprites/mid/hero/stay.png, Offset: 4569, Size: 4557
```

The `.pak` file name would be `hero.pak` and the path in the build folder would be:

```
bin/<Build-tool>/sprites/mid/hero.pak
```

---

**Explanation**

* **Offset** â€“ Position of the file in the data section of the `.pak` file
* **Size** â€“ Size of the file in bytes
* **Path** â€“ Path of the file inside the `.pak` file

This recursive structure allows the program to load each `.pak` file independently, ensuring that subfolders create separate `.pak` files and no files are included from other folders.

## Lazy Loader

The **Lazy Loader** is a system for **automatic texture management** in this project. It ensures that textures are **loaded only when needed**, reduces **memory usage**, and replaces missing textures with **placeholder textures** so the program can **continue running smoothly**.

### How It Works

* Each texture is identified by a unique **ID**.
* When a texture is requested with a given ID:

  * **If it is already loaded**, it is returned immediately.
  * **If it is not loaded yet** and paths are provided, the ID and its associated file paths are automatically **added to the lazy-loading queue**. This tells the loader to load the texture **in the background during the next loading cycle**.
  * Until the texture is available, a **placeholder texture** is returned so the program keeps running without interruption.

### Methods

1. **`GetTexture(id, paths...)`**

   * Retrieves a texture by its ID.
   * If the texture does not exist yet and paths are provided, it is **added to the lazy-loading queue** for background loading.
   * While the texture is not yet available, a **placeholder** is returned.

2. **`AddTexture(id, paths...)`**

   * Adds a texture to the lazy-loading queue **in advance**, without loading it immediately.
   * Useful when you want to **prepare certain textures** but defer their loading until they are actually needed.
   * This function is optional because `GetTexture` uses the same mechanism automatically if the texture is missing.

3. **`AddTextureInstantly(renderer, id, paths...)`**

   * Loads a texture **immediately** and adds it to the `TextureManager`.
   * Useful if a texture must be available **right from the start** or at a specific point in time.

### Quality Levels & Fallback System

When adding a texture, you can provide multiple **file paths for different quality levels**, starting from the **lowest quality on the left** to the **highest quality on the right**.
The target quality level is defined in the **`WindowConfig`**.

* The loader first tries to load the texture in the **selected quality level**.
* **If that level is not available**, it automatically **falls back step by step to lower quality levels**, trying each until one can be loaded. This process continues **recursively** until a valid texture is found.
* If **none of the paths** can be loaded, the loader will automatically generate and use a **placeholder texture**, ensuring the program continues running smoothly.

This fallback system allows you to easily control how detailed your graphics should be while ensuring that your program remains stable even if certain assets are missing or corrupted.

## Installing vcpkg (C++ Package Manager)

Clone and bootstrap vcpkg:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git external/vcpkg
cd external/vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
cd ../..
```

### Note for Debian 13 Users

On Debian 13, the `dbus` dependency for SDL3 does not work correctly and must be disabled.

**How to fix:**

1. Open the following file:
   `external/vcpkg/ports/sdl3/vcpkg.json`

2. Replace the dependencies section:

**Original**

```json
"dependencies": [
    { "name": "dbus", "default-features": false, "platform": "linux" },
    { "name": "vcpkg-cmake", "host": true },
    { "name": "vcpkg-cmake-config", "host": true }
]
```

**Change to**

```json
"dependencies": [
    { "name": "vcpkg-cmake", "host": true },
    { "name": "vcpkg-cmake-config", "host": true }
]
```

## Using the Makefile Shortcuts

A `Makefile` is provided in the project root to simplify common build and run tasks:

| Command                  | Description                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `make build-linux-gcc`   | Build the project using GCC on Linux      |
| `make build-linux-clang` | Build the project using Clang on Linux    |
| `make build-windows`     | Build the project for Windows (MSVC only) |
| `make clean`             | Remove all build and binary directories   |
| `make clean-linux-gcc`   | Clean only GCC build and binaries         |
| `make clean-linux-clang` | Clean only Clang build and binaries       |
| `make clean-windows`     | Clean only Windows build and binaries     |
| `make run-linux-gcc`     | Run the GCC-built executable on Linux     |
| `make run-linux-clang`   | Run the Clang-built executable on Linux   |
| `make run-windows`       | Run the Windows executable (Windows only) |

These shortcuts help you quickly build, clean, and run your project without manually invoking CMake or copying assets.
